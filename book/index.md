# **Estimation Alignment Hub**

*A unified system for improving predictability, reducing delivery risk, and aligning expectations across the full software lifecycle.*

---

## **1. Why This Hub Exists**

Software teams use multiple estimation methods — FTEs, story points, sprints, velocity, cost models, forecasting ranges — but none of them speak the same language.
This creates predictable failures:

* RFP assumptions don’t match delivery reality
* discovery/design workload is underestimated
* story points drift away from original expectations
* velocity rises while timelines still slip
* scope expands invisibly until it becomes a crisis
* teams feel pressure instead of clarity
* client trust is damaged

This hub introduces a **single alignment model** for the entire lifecycle by grounding all estimation methods in two shared dimensions:

* **Complexity (known work)**
* **Uncertainty (unknown work)**

When these dimensions are explicitly measured and tracked, the organization gains:

* predictable delivery
* early detection of risk
* better discovery/design planning
* realistic client expectations
* clearer trade-off decisions
* improved collaboration across roles
* alignment across the 3SF triangle (Engagement ↔ Delivery ↔ Value)

## **2. What This Hub Provides**

This space contains **five tightly connected pages**, each answering a different “why” and “how” of estimation alignment.
