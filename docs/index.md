# ⭐ **Estimation Alignment Hub**

*A unified system for improving predictability, reducing delivery risk, and aligning expectations across the full software lifecycle.*

---

## **1. Why This Hub Exists**

Software teams use multiple estimation methods — FTEs, story points, sprints, velocity, cost models, forecasting ranges — but none of them speak the same language.
This creates predictable failures:

* RFP assumptions don’t match delivery reality
* discovery/design workload is underestimated
* story points drift away from original expectations
* velocity rises while timelines still slip
* scope expands invisibly until it becomes a crisis
* teams feel pressure instead of clarity
* client trust is damaged

This hub introduces a **single alignment model** for the entire lifecycle by grounding all estimation methods in two shared dimensions:

* **Complexity (known work)**
* **Uncertainty (unknown work)**

When these dimensions are explicitly measured and tracked, the organization gains:

* predictable delivery
* early detection of risk
* better discovery/design planning
* realistic client expectations
* clearer trade-off decisions
* improved collaboration across roles
* alignment across the 3SF triangle (Engagement ↔ Delivery ↔ Value)

## **2. What This Hub Provides**

This space contains **five tightly connected pages**, each answering a different “why” and “how” of estimation alignment.

Below is a quick start overview.

---

# 📘 **Quick Start Guide**

## **Page 1 — The Model: Complexity & Uncertainty Framework**

*Why estimation fails, and the shared model that fixes it.*

This page defines:

* the two missing dimensions
* the lifecycle alignment model
* complexity & uncertainty drivers
* baseline creation
* how the model supports 3SF (Engagement–Delivery–Value)

**Purpose:**  
Create a shared mental model across PM, EM, BA, PD, Architect, Dev, QA, and leadership.

---

## **Page 2 — Translation Map**

*How all estimation methods connect to each other.*

This page explains how complexity & uncertainty map to:

* RFP cost estimates
* story points & slicing
* discovery & design effort
* forecasting models
* value-based prioritization
* dependency & NFR workloads

**Purpose:**  
Give teams one “Rosetta Stone” that aligns FTEs, SPs, velocity, forecasting, and value.

---

## **Page 3 — Scoring Sheet Framework**

*How teams quantify complexity & uncertainty in practice.*

This page defines:

* scoring mechanics
* baseline creation
* drift tracking
* uncertainty burn-down
* mapping complexity to story points
* structure for the new Excel tool

**Purpose:**  
Provide a consistent operational method to measure and track scope across RFP → Discovery → Delivery.

---

## **Page 4 — Estimation & Delivery Diagnostic**

*How to identify where the estimation system is breaking — and why.*

This page gives:

* a 4-domain diagnostic
* scoring model
* health index
* common failure patterns
* root causes
* recommendations linked to 3SF lines

**Purpose:**  
Offer PMs, EMs, Directors, and Practice Leads a fast way to detect misalignment and intervene early.

---

## **Page 5 — Implementation Stages Plan**

*How to adopt this model across the organization.*

This page includes:

* rollout strategy
* pilot selection
* refinement loops
* communication plan
* RACI
* risk mitigation
* timeline
* institutionalization plan

**Purpose:**  
Ensure sustainable, low-friction adoption across teams, portfolios, and leadership levels.

---

# 🎯 **3. Who Should Use This Hub**

This hub is designed for:

* Engineering Directors
* Practice Leads (Engineering, PM, PD, BA, QA, Architecture)
* Project Leads
* Engineering Managers
* Product Designers
* Business Analysts
* Architects
* Senior Developers
* Anyone involved in estimation, scoping, planning, or forecasting

# 🧭 **4. How to Navigate**

Use the pages in the following sequence:

1. **Start with [The Model](100-model.md)** → understand the model
2. **Move to [The Map](110-map.md)** → understand the translation relationships
3. **Review [The Scoring](120-scoring.md)** → understand scoring mechanics and baseline creation
4. **Use [The Diagnostic](130-diagnostic.md)** → assess current project health
5. **Share [The Plan](140-plan.md)** → plan adoption with your leadership
5. **Read [The FAQ](150-faq.md)** → find answers from different perspectives

This sequence mirrors the natural flow of learning and change.

---

# 🚀 **5. What This Enables**

Once adopted, this model unlocks:

* predictable delivery
* coherent estimation culture
* consistent upstream and downstream alignment
* early detection of drift
* fewer escalations
* stronger client relationships
* better portfolio-level visibility
* alignment across the 3SF Engagement–Delivery–Value loop

It becomes a long-term capability inside the organization — not a one-time process change.
