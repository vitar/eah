# ⭐ **How Do We Prevent Story Point Inflation or Re-Estimation Games?**

> **We prevent story point inflation by anchoring SP to complexity ranges, scoring complexity separately, updating the baseline when drift occurs, and using SP only for slicing and flow — never for forecasting, cost, or performance.  
> This restores honesty, stability, and predictability.**

*Why story points drift, and how the Complexity & Uncertainty Model restores honesty and stability.*

---

## **1. Why This Question Exists**

Teams often see story points **inflate**, shift, or drift over time.
Common symptoms:

* “Everything became a 5… then an 8… then a 13…”
* “Velocity went up, but timelines still slipped.”
* “We re-estimated all stories and magically created ‘more velocity.’”
* “Story points no longer correlate to actual complexity.”
* “Product thinks we’re slow; Engineering thinks the estimation was wrong.”

The underlying issue:
**Story points are being used for the wrong purpose.**

Teams use them as:

* effort estimates
* deadlines
* KPIs
* velocity boosters
* negotiation tools

All of these uses contaminate the system.

This page explains how the Complexity & Uncertainty Model fixes it.

## **2. What Story Points Are — and Are Not**

### **Story Points *are*:**

* a tool for relative sizing
* a way for the *delivery team* to compare slices of work
* a mechanism to help forecast throughput
* a tactical unit for planning sprints

### **Story Points *are not*:**

* a cost estimate
* a measure of value
* a measure of performance
* a commitment
* a delivery target
* a proxy for complexity
* a tool for “how long will this take”

This is where inflation starts:
SP are pulled into a role they were never meant to fill.

## **3. Why Story Points Drift (The Real Causes)**

### **Cause 1 — No baseline complexity model**

Teams re-size stories without knowing what the RFP assumed.

### **Cause 2 — Uncertainty is not quantified**

Teams inflate points to account for unknowns.

### **Cause 3 — SP attached to deadlines**

Teams make points bigger to look faster.

### **Cause 4 — No complexity range mapping**

Simplicity becomes subjective → inflation grows.

### **Cause 5 — Missing drift tracking**

Delivery cannot detect when complexity grows, so they compensate by re-estimating.

### **Cause 6 — SP used for performance management**

Teams become defensive; points become political.

## **4. How the Complexity Model Fixes Point Inflation**

The key is simple:

> **Story points no longer describe complexity.  
> Complexity describes complexity.**

SP return to their intended purpose:
**estimating slices of known work**, not interpreting RFP assumptions.

Here’s the structural fix.

---

### ⭐ **Fix 1 — Story points map to complexity ranges**

Each complexity level has a bounded SP range:

| Complexity Level | SP Range     |
| ---------------- | ------------ |
| Low (1–3)        | 1–3          |
| Medium (4–7)     | 5–8          |
| High (8–12)      | 13–21        |
| Extreme (13+)    | >21 or split |

This removes:

* runaway story point escalation
* re-estimation inflation
* subjective inflation
* “this feels big so let’s make it a 13” behavior

Now SP have *meaningful constraints.*

---

### ⭐ **Fix 2 — Re-estimation cannot overwrite the baseline**

Delivery cannot simply “make stories bigger.”
They must classify:

* **new complexity** → complexity drift
* **uncertainty discovered** → uncertainty drift

This builds honesty into the system.

---

### ⭐ **Fix 3 — SP measure delivery slicing, not RFP assumptions**

RFP complexity is scored.
Delivery complexity is sliced.

SP only measure:

* how thinly
* how appropriately
* how predictably
* the team slices a feature into implementable increments

Not:

* scope
* unknowns
* architecture load
* integration risk

These belong to the complexity baseline.

---

### ⭐ **Fix 4 — Velocity is interpreted correctly**

With complexity tracked separately:

* velocity becomes a *capacity signal*
* velocity no longer becomes a *pressure valve*
* velocity stops being gamed
* velocity stays stable over time
* velocity becomes comparable across sprints

Delivery regains trust in its own metrics.

---

### ⭐ **Fix 5 — Uncertainty is handled with spikes, not point inflation**

Unknowns trigger:

* spikes
* clarification sessions
* PoCs

Not:

* “make it a 13 just in case”

This prevents SP from absorbing risk incorrectly.

---

## **5. How PM and PL Enforce the Fix**

### **PM responsibilities:**

* ensure every EPIC has a complexity score
* ensure uncertainty is scored and tracked
* identify new complexity early
* align with PL in weekly track sync

### **PL / EM responsibilities:**

* ensure SP within the allowed range for complexity level
* prevent re-estimation from masking drift
* ensure SP reflect slices, not assumptions
* ensure velocity remains a capacity indicator

### **Shared responsibilities:**

* maintain Complexity Baseline
* communicate drift
* align forecast expectations

---

## **6. What This Looks Like in Real Scenarios**

### **Before:**

Integration becomes more complex → team re-estimates from 8 → 13 → 21 → 34 points.

Velocity appears to rise.
Timeline still slips.
Trust erodes.

### **After:**

Integration complexity increases → team rescoring shows +7 drift → PM/PL renegotiate scope and forecast → velocity stays clean → stakeholders understand why timeline moves.

Trust increases.
