# **How Estimation Aligns Across Dual-Track Scrum (Discovery + Delivery)?**

> **Discovery estimates complexity & uncertainty, Delivery estimates slices & story points, and PM/PL keep both tracks aligned by maintaining a shared Complexity Baseline, a readiness buffer, and weekly track syncs.**
> This makes Dual-Track predictable, measurable, and aligned end-to-end.

*How PM and PL keep both tracks synchronized using Complexity & Uncertainty.*

---

Understood — here is a **compact version** matching the length and style of the other FAQ intros:

## **1. Why This Question Matters**

Dual-Track Scrum means:

* **Discovery track** continuously clarifies *what* to build
* **Delivery track** continuously builds *what is ready*

The two tracks operate in parallel, but they do **not** estimate the same way and they absolutely need a **shared coordination model**.

Dual-Track Scrum often fails not because of the idea, but because estimation, readiness, and uncertainty are tracked differently in each stream. Discovery works with ambiguity and problem exploration; Delivery works with sliced work and predictable flow. Without a shared model, the tracks drift:

* Discovery outputs aren’t ready when Delivery needs them
* Delivery discovers hidden complexity too late
* Uncertainty isn’t visible across tracks
* Planning becomes reactive instead of intentional

This question matters because Dual-Track only succeeds when both tracks speak the **same estimation language** and connect their work through shared complexity, uncertainty, and baseline signals.

The Complexity & Uncertainty framework acts as that shared model.

Here’s how it works.

---

## **2. Dual-Track Roles in Estimation**

### **Discovery Track (Upstream)**

Owned by: PM, BA, PD, Architect
Focus: Understanding the problem, clarifying requirements, reducing uncertainty.

### **Delivery Track (Downstream)**

Owned by: PL (Engineering Manager or Tech Lead), Delivery Team
Focus: Implementing validated features, estimating slices/stories, controlling flow.

---

## **3. What Each Track Estimates**

### **Discovery estimates:**

* **Complexity (drivers)** → integration, data, UX, logic, dependencies
* **Uncertainty** → requirements, documentation gaps, PoCs needed
* **Discovery workload** → PM/BA/PD/Architect time
* **Baseline adjustments** → after clarifying reality

This track feeds Delivery.

---

### **Delivery estimates:**

* **Story point ranges** (derived from complexity baseline)
* **Cycle times**
* **Throughput / WIP**
* **Sprint commitments**
* **Flow risks**

This track executes against Discovery outputs.

---

## **4. How PM & PL Align Both Tracks (Practical Workflow)**

Below is the alignment loop that keeps Discovery and Delivery synchronized and predictable.

---

### ⭐ **Step 1 — Discovery produces the Complexity & Uncertainty scores**

This happens *before* a feature enters Delivery.

Discovery generates:

* Complexity Score
* Uncertainty Score
* Updated Complexity Baseline (v2/v3)
* Clarified requirements & UX flows
* Spike outcomes (if needed)

This ensures Delivery never estimates blindly.

---

### ⭐ **Step 2 — PM & PL meet weekly for a “Track Sync”**

Agenda:

1. **What’s ready to enter Delivery?**
2. **Has any complexity drift occurred?**
3. **Is uncertainty decreasing as expected?**
4. **Are dependencies becoming clearer or riskier?**
5. **Is Discovery producing enough ready work for upcoming sprints?**

This replaces the old “refinement chaos” with a structured alignment loop.

---

### ⭐ **Step 3 — Delivery maps incoming items to Story Points**

Story points are **not** estimated independently.
They’re **anchored** to the complexity baseline:

| Complexity | SP Range |
| ---------- | -------- |
| Low        | 1–3      |
| Medium     | 5–8      |
| High       | 13–21    |
| Extreme    | Split    |

This keeps Delivery honest and prevents point inflation.

---

### ⭐ **Step 4 — PM tracks Discovery Burn-up vs. Delivery Burn-down**

Discovery should run **ahead** of Delivery by at least 1–2 sprints.

PM tracks:

* number of clarified features
* uncertainty reduction
* upcoming complexity
* readiness for slicing

PL tracks:

* sprint commitments
* throughput
* cycle time
* capacity risks

**The PM and PL jointly maintain a shared “Readiness Buffer.”**

This is key in Dual-Track environments.

---

### ⭐ **Step 5 — Both tracks update the Complexity Baseline as new information emerges**

Discovery updates it when clarity increases.
Delivery updates it when drift is discovered.

The baseline sits at the midpoint between tracks — the shared “truth.”

---

### ⭐ **Step 6 — PM & PL realign timelines based on complexity & uncertainty changes**

Not velocity.

Velocity is a *capacity signal*, not a planning tool.

Instead, forecasting uses:

* updated complexity totals
* updated uncertainty levels
* updated batch sizes
* delivery throughput

This allows for transparent communication with stakeholders.

---

## **5. Flow of Artifacts Across Tracks**

### **From Discovery → Delivery**

* feature descriptions
* UX flows
* acceptance criteria
* complexity scores
* uncertainty scores
* dependencies map
* ready-for-delivery signals (DoR)

### **From Delivery → Discovery**

* complexity drift signals
* validation feedback
* cycle-time insights
* integration blockers
* refinement requests

This bi-directional flow is the connective tissue of Dual-Track.

## **6. Where PM and PL Responsibilities Overlap vs. Divide**

| -------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------- | ------ |
| Define complexity drivers  | ✔️                   | ➖                   | ✔️     |
| Score uncertainty          | ✔️                   | ➖                   | ✔️     |
| Create Complexity Baseline | ✔️                   | ✔️                  | ✔️     |
| Maintain readiness buffer  | ✔️                   | ✔️                  | ✔️     |
| Create Story Points        | ➖                    | ✔️                  | ✔️     |
| Track complexity drift     | ✔️                   | ✔️                  | ✔️     |
| Forecast timelines         | ✔️                   | ✔️                  | ✔️     |
| Manage sprint flow         | ➖                    | ✔️                  | ➖      |
| Manage Discovery cadence   | ✔️                   | ➖                   | ➖      |

This table clarifies how Dual-Track roles share ownership.

## **7. Why This Model Fits 3SF Perfectly**

### **Engagement (Client ↔ Vendor)**

Discovery provides realistic expectations through complexity & uncertainty visibility.

### **Delivery (Vendor ↔ Product)**

Dual-track synchronization reduces surprises and removes pressure to “increase velocity.”

### **Value (Product ↔ Client)**

Clear trade-offs emerge because complexity is quantified early.

The dual-track sync is essentially a 3SF “flow stabilizer.”
