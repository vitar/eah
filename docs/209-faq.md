# **What Happens When New Scope Appears Mid-Project — How Do We Score, Track, and Communicate It?**

> **When new scope appears, we score it using the same complexity and uncertainty drivers, compare it against the baseline, and present clear trade-off options to the client.  
> This keeps delivery stable, protects the team, and turns scope changes into professional, data-driven decisions — not disruption.**

*A structured way to handle scope additions without chaos, conflict, or timeline collapse.*

---

## **1. Why This Question Matters**

Every real project experiences mid-flight scope additions:

* new features
* new workflows
* new integrations
* new compliance requirements
* new UX needs
* new stakeholder requests
* “can we just add X?”
* “we forgot Y”
* “we discovered Z during delivery”

The challenge is not the new scope itself — it’s the *disruption* it causes.

Most teams fall into one of two failure modes:

### **Failure Mode A — Absorb everything**

→ hidden debt
→ collapsing timelines
→ burnout
→ failed expectations
→ eroded trust

### **Failure Mode B — Reject everything**

→ stakeholder frustration
→ scope battles
→ political conflict

Neither is professional.

This page explains how to handle new scope using the Complexity & Uncertainty Model — without collapsing the delivery system.

## **2. Core Principle: New Scope Enters the System the Same Way as Original Scope**

Instead of treating new scope as a special case:

> **New scope is treated exactly like original scope — scored, baselined, and evaluated using the same drivers.**

This creates:

* fairness
* consistency
* predictability
* transparency

And eliminates emotional or political responses.

---

## **3. When New Scope Appears, There Are Three Required Steps**

### **Step 1 — Score the new scope**

### **Step 2 — Compare against the baseline**

### **Step 3 — Present options and trade-offs to the client**

Everything flows from this.

Let’s break these down.

---

## **4. Step 1 — Score the New Scope (Complexity + Uncertainty)**

PM, BA, PD, Architect, and EM/PL quickly score the new item:

### **Complexity drivers**:

* integration
* data
* UX
* logic
* NFR
* environment
* external dependencies

### **Uncertainty drivers**:

* requirement clarity
* documentation
* ownership
* ambiguity
* dependency stability

This scoring usually takes **3–10 minutes**, because:

* the model is simple
* the scoring scale is small (0–3–5)
* each role contributes only what they know
* drivers are familiar across the team

The result is a structured assessment instead of a vague “this feels big.”

---

## **5. Step 2 — Compare the New Scope Against the Baseline**

This reveals its real impact.

### Evaluate:

* total complexity change
* uncertainty level
* integration with existing features
* cross-team impact
* drift trend
* value vs complexity ratio
* feasibility in the current release

### New scope becomes one of four categories:

| Category                        | Meaning          | Example Action                                  |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **High value, low complexity**  | A good add       | Fit into release, or swap with something bigger |
| **High value, high complexity** | Needs trade-offs | Extend timeline OR drop another feature         |
| **Low value, low complexity**   | Opportunistic    | Add only if capacity allows                     |
| **Low value, high complexity**  | Decline          | Move to backlog or de-scope                     |

Instead of “no” or “yes,” the conversation becomes *structured decision-making*.

---

## **6. Step 3 — Present Clear Options to the Client**

The PM presents the impact **factually**, with **choices**, not demands.

### Example structure:

1. **What changed**

   * “New compliance workflow added.”
   * “Integration with vendor X needed.”

2. **Complexity & uncertainty score**

   * “+8 complexity, +3 uncertainty.”

3. **Impact**

   * “This adds 2–3 weeks of work.”

4. **Options**

   * Option A: extend timeline
   * Option B: increase capacity (if possible)
   * Option C: replace Feature B with new Feature X
   * Option D: split X into a smaller version for MVP

5. **Recommendation**

   * backed by value × complexity analysis

Clients trust structured recommendations, not emotional reactions.

## **7. How New Scope Fits Into Dual-Track Scrum**

### **Discovery Track**

Quickly clarifies new scope:

* requirements
* UX
* dependencies
* uncertainty
* complexity drivers

### **Delivery Track**

Receives:

* a scored item
* a ready-for-delivery view
* a decision (include, swap, delay, decline)

No chaos. No “urgent” interruptions.  
The tracks remain synchronized.

---

## **8. How PM and PL Share the Work**

### **PM responsibilities:**

* ensure new scope is captured
* facilitate complexity/uncertainty scoring
* assess value
* prepare trade-off options
* communicate with stakeholders
* align sequencing
* protect the roadmap

### **PL / EM responsibilities:**

* validate technical complexity
* assess delivery impact
* identify dependency risks
* propose alternative low-complexity approaches

Together, PM + PL create a shared, unified recommendation.

---

## **9. How This Model Reduces Conflict**

### Without the model:

* new scope creates panic
* team absorbs everything
* stakeholders escalate
* timeline slips without explanation
* trust erodes

### With the model:

* new scope is scored
* impact is quantified
* trade-offs are clear
* client chooses path forward
* timeline adjustments are grounded
* team feels protected
* stakeholders feel respected

Everyone operates like professionals, not firefighters.

## **10. How 3SF Supports New Scope Decisions**

### **Engagement Line (client ↔ vendor)**

The conversation becomes transparent and collaborative.

### **Delivery Line (vendor ↔ product)**

Teams stay stable because new scope is structured, not disruptive.

### **Value Line (product ↔ client)**

Every decision ties to value × complexity, not internal pressure or politics.
